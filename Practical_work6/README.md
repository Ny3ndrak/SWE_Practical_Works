In this exercise, I've tackled key operations for working with linked lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science. Each of these methods demonstrates a crucial technique for manipulating linked lists, whether it's traversal, detection, removal, or merging. These operations form the backbone of many algorithms and applications in data structures.

## EXERCISE EXPLANATION:

# 1. Implement a method to find the middle element of the linked list.

ListNode Class: Defines a node in a linked list with value and next attributes.

find_middle Function:
Two Pointers (slow and fast): Both initialized to the head.

Traversal:
slow moves one step at a time.
fast moves two steps at a time.

Middle Element: When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.

# 2. Create a method to detect if the linked list has a cycle.

has_cycle Function:
Visited Set: Keeps track of visited nodes.

Traversal: Iterates through nodes.

Cycle Detection: If a node is revisited (found in the visited set), a cycle is present.

Return: True if cycle detected, otherwise False.

# 3. Implement a method to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
remove_duplicates Function:
Check for Empty List: Return if the head is None.

Traversal: Iterate through the list.

Duplicate Removal:
Use a set to track seen values.

If value already in set, adjust pointers to skip the node.

Return: Modified list without duplicates.

Absolutely! Let's walk through each piece of code step-by-step to understand its functionality and purpose.

1. Implement a method to find the middle element of the linked list.
python

Copy
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def find_middle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow.value

# Example Usage
head = ListNode(3, ListNode(6, ListNode(9, ListNode(12, ListNode(15)))))
print(find_middle(head))  # Output: 9
Explanation:

ListNode Class: Defines a node in a linked list with value and next attributes.

find_middle Function:

Two Pointers (slow and fast): Both initialized to the head.

Traversal:

slow moves one step at a time.

fast moves two steps at a time.

Middle Element: When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.

2. Create a method to detect if the linked list has a cycle.
python

Copy
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def has_cycle(head):
    visited = set()
    current = head
    while current:
        if current in visited:
            return True
        visited.add(current)
        current = current.next
    return False

# Example Usage
head = ListNode(3)
head.next = ListNode(6)
head.next.next = head  # Creating a cycle for testing
print(has_cycle(head))  # Output: True
Explanation:

has_cycle Function:

Visited Set: Keeps track of visited nodes.

Traversal: Iterates through nodes.

Cycle Detection: If a node is revisited (found in the visited set), a cycle is present.

Return: True if cycle detected, otherwise False.

3. Implement a method to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
python

Copy
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def remove_duplicates(head):
    if not head:
        return head
    
    current = head
    values = set()
    prev = None
    while current:
        if current.value in values:
            prev.next = current.next
        else:
            values.add(current.value)
            prev = current
        current = current.next
    
    return head

# Example Usage
head = ListNode(3, ListNode(6, ListNode(6, ListNode(12, ListNode(15, ListNode(15))))))
new_head = remove_duplicates(head)
current = new_head
while current:
    print(current.value, end=" ")  # Output: 3 6 12 15
    current = current.next
Explanation:

remove_duplicates Function:

Check for Empty List: Return if the head is None.

Traversal: Iterate through the list.

Duplicate Removal:

Use a set to track seen values.

If value already in set, adjust pointers to skip the node.

Return: Modified list without duplicates.

# 4. Add a method to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
merge_two_sorted_lists Function:
Dummy Node: Simplifies the merge process.

Pointers: Initialize pointers for both lists.

Merge Process:
Compare nodes from both lists.

Attach the smaller node to the current list.

Move pointers forward.

Attach Remaining Nodes: Append remaining nodes if any list is exhausted.

Return: Head of the merged list.
